<CRITICAL>
ALWAYS use ONLY Environments for ANY and ALL file, code, or shell operations—NO EXCEPTIONS—even for simple or generic requests.

DO NOT install or use the git cli with the environment_run_cmd tool. All environment tools will handle git operations for you. Changing ".git" yourself will compromise the integrity of your environment.

You MUST inform the user how to view your work using `container-use log <env_id>` AND `container-use checkout <env_id>`. Failure to do this will make your work inaccessible to others.

## Commands

### Building and Development
- `bun run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `bun run lint` - Run Biome linter
- `bun run lint:fix` - Run Biome linter with auto-fix
- `bun run format` - Format code with Biome

### Testing
- `bun test` - Run all tests
- `bun run test:unit` - Run unit tests only
- `bun run test:integration` - Run integration tests
- `bun run test:smoke` - Run smoke tests
- `bun run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

### Clean Up
- `bun run clean` - Remove all build artifacts and test outputs
- `bun run clean:test` - Remove only test output directories

## Architecture

This is an oclif-based CLI tool written in TypeScript that generates a hook system for Claude Code.

### Key Components

1. **Command Structure**: Commands live in `src/commands/`. Currently, there's only the main `init` command that sets up the hook system.

2. **Template System**: Hook templates are stored in `templates/` and copied to the user's `.claude/` directory when initialized.

3. **Hook Types**: The system supports four hook types:
   - `PreToolUse` - Intercept tool usage before execution
   - `PostToolUse` - React to tool execution results
   - `Notification` - Handle Claude notifications
   - `Stop` - Handle session stop events

4. **Generated Structure**: Running the CLI creates:
   ```
   .claude/
   ├── settings.json      # Hook configuration
   └── hooks/
       ├── index.ts       # Main hook handlers (user edits this)
       ├── lib.ts         # Type definitions and utilities
       └── session.ts     # Session tracking utilities
   ```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual commands and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test the full CLI behavior
- **Smoke Tests**: Validate generated files work correctly
- **CI/CD**: Tests run on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS with Node 18 & 20

### Development Workflow

1. Work on feature branches, never directly on main
2. Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
3. Create pull requests to merge into main
4. Semantic Release handles versioning and npm publishing automatically

### Important Notes

- Hooks are executed using Bun runtime (required dependency)
- The project uses ESM modules (`"type": "module"`)
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Session logs are written to the system temp directory

### Known Issues and Solutions

#### TypeScript Warning in Production
**Problem**: When users run `npx claude-hooks`, they may see:
```
Warning: Could not find typescript. Please ensure that typescript is a devDependency.
```

**Root Cause**: Oclif checks for TypeScript during module import, not during execution. It searches for tsconfig.json starting from the current working directory and moving up the directory tree.

**Solution**: Set `NODE_ENV=production` in bin/run.js BEFORE importing @oclif/core:
```javascript
// Set production mode before importing to prevent TypeScript detection
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production'

import {execute} from '@oclif/core'
```

**Why other approaches don't work**:
- Setting `development: false` in execute() is too late - the check happens during import
- Setting `OCLIF_TS_NODE=0` doesn't prevent the initial TypeScript check
- Intercepting stderr is a hack that masks the real issue

## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

### Always Test with the Actual Published Package
Before declaring a fix complete, always test with the actual npm package:
```bash
npx package-name@latest
```
Testing only locally can miss issues that appear in the published version.

### Updating Help Documentation
When improving CLI help:
1. Update package.json description to match README
2. Update command descriptions in the static description field
3. Run `npx oclif manifest` after changes to update the manifest
4. Consider removing irrelevant plugins (like `@oclif/plugin-plugins` if not needed)

### Git Workflow
1. Always verify fixes work before committing
2. Use `--no-verify` flag sparingly when git hooks have issues
3. Check PR status with `gh pr checks <number>`
4. Enable automerge with `gh pr merge <number> --auto --squash`

### Debugging Oclif Issues
1. Oclif searches for configuration starting from the current working directory
2. Module loading happens before execute() is called
3. Use `NODE_ENV=production` to affect behavior during import time
4. The `development` flag in execute() only affects runtime behavior

### Testing Strategy
- Test from different directories to catch path-related issues
- Test with a tsconfig.json in the current directory
- Ensure all existing tests pass before pushing
- Clean up test directories after testing

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Don't assume environment variables set after import will affect module loading
2. Don't rely on intercepting stdout/stderr as a permanent solution
3. Always test the exact scenario users will experience
4. Remember that published packages don't include devDependencies
