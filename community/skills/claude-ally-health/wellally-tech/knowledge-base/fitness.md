## Exercise Assessment Tools

### Exercise Capacity Assessment

Use the exercise analysis features of the Claude-Ally-Health system:

```bash
# Use the fitness command to record exercise
/fitness

# Use fitness-analyzer to analyze exercise data
/fitness-analyzer

# Generate comprehensive health report
/report
```

### Related Metrics

The following exercise metrics can be obtained from health data:

- **Steps**: Daily walking steps
- **Distance**: Walking/running distance
- **Active Time**: Moderate to high-intensity activity time
- **Resting Heart Rate**: Morning resting heart rate
- **Exercise Heart Rate**: Heart rate during exercise
- **Calorie Expenditure**: Energy expended during activity
- **Exercise Frequency**: Number of exercise sessions per week

## Exercise Recommendations

### Activity Level Recommendations

**World Health Organization (WHO) Recommendations**:
- Adults (18-64 years): At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise
- Older adults (65+ years): At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity per week, plus strength training 2 or more days per week
- Children/Adolescents: At least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity exercise daily

**Daily Activity Recommendations**:
- Daily steps: 8,000-10,000 steps
- Active time: At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity daily
- Sedentary time: Stand and move for 5 minutes every hour

### Exercise Intensity Assessment

**Subjective Feeling Method (RPE)**:
- Light: 1-3 points, can speak easily
- Moderate: 4-6 points, can speak in sentences but cannot sing
- Vigorous: 7-8 points, can only speak a few words
- Maximum: 9-10 points, unable to speak

**Heart Rate Zones**:
- Light: 50-60% of maximum heart rate
- Moderate: 60-70% of maximum heart rate
- Vigorous: 70-85% of maximum heart rate
- Maximum: 85-100% of maximum heart rate

**Maximum Heart Rate Estimation**:
- Simplified formula: Maximum HR = 220 - age
- More accurate: Maximum HR = 208 - (0.7 × age)
