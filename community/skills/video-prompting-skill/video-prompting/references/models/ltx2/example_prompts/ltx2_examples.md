## Example Prompts

1. An action packed, cinematic shot of a monster truck driving fast towards the camera, the truck passes the cameras it pans left to follow the trucks reckless drive. dust and motion blur is around the truck, hand held feel to the camera as it tries to track its ride into the distance. the truck then drifts and turns around, then drives back towards the camera until seen in extreme close up.
2. A warm sunny backyard. The camera starts in a tight cinematic close-up of a woman and a man in their 30s, facing each other with serious expressions. The woman, emotional and dramatic, says softly, "That's it... Dad's lost it. And we've lost Dad." The man exhales, slightly annoyed: "Stop being so dramatic, Jess." A beat. He glances aside, then mutters defensively, "He's just having fun." The camera slowly pans right, revealing the grandfather in the garden wearing enormous butterfly wings, waving his arms in the air like he's trying to take off. He shouts, "Wheeeew!" as he flaps his wings with full commitment. The woman covers her face, on the verge of tears. The tone is deadpan, absurd, and quietly tragic.
3. INT. OVEN - DAY. Static camera from inside the oven, looking outward through the slightly fogged glass door. Warm golden light glows around freshly baked cookies. The baker's face fills the frame, eyes wide with focus, his breath fogging the glass as he leans in. Subtle reflections move across the glass as steam rises. Baker (whispering dramatically): "Today... I achieve perfection." He leans even closer, nose nearly touching the glass. "Golden edges. Soft center. The gods themselves will smell these cookies and weep." Baker: "Wait-" (beat) "Did I... forget the chocolate chips?" Cut to side view - coworker pops into frame, chewing casually. Coworker (mouth full): "Nope. You forgot the sugar." Quick zoom back to the baker's horrified face, pressed against the oven door, as cookies deflate behind the glass. Steam drifts upward in slow motion. pixar style acting and timing
4. NT. DAYTIME TALK SHOW SET - AFTERNOON Soft studio lighting glows across a warm-toned set. The audience murmurs faintly as the camera pans to reveal three guests seated on a couch - a middle-aged couple and the show's host sitting across from them. The host leans forward, voice steady but probing: Host: "When did you first notice that your daughter, Missy, started to spiral?" The woman's face crumples; she takes a shaky breath and begins to cry. Her husband places a comforting hand on her shoulder, looking down before turning back toward the host. Father (quietly, with guilt): "We... we don't know what we did wrong." The studio falls silent for a moment. The camera cuts to the host, who looks gravely into the lens. Host (to camera): "Let's take a look at a short piece our team prepared - chronicling Missy's downward path." The lights dim slightly as the camera pushes in on the mother's tear-streaked face. The studio monitors flicker to life, beginning to play the segment as the audience holds its breath.
5. Pinocchio is sitting in an interrogation room, looking nervous, and slightly sweating. He's saying very quietly to himself "I didn't do it... I didn't do it... I'm not a murderer". Pinocchio's nose is quickly getting longer and longer. The camera is zooming in on the double sided mirror in the back of the room, The mirror is turning black as the camera approaches it, and exposes a blurry silhouette of two FBI detectives who stand in the dark lit room on the other side. One of them is saying "I'm telling you, I have a feeling something is off with this kiddo

8. The camera opens in a calm, sunlit frog yoga studio. Warm morning light washes over the wooden floor as incense smoke drifts lazily in the air. The senior frog instructor sits cross-legged at the center, eyes closed, voice deep and calm. "We are one with the pond." All the frogs answer softly: "Ommm..." "We are one with the mud." "Ommm..." He smiles faintly. "We are one with the flies." A quiet pause. The camera slowly pans to the side - one frog twitches, eyes darting. Suddenly - _thwip!_ - its tongue snaps out, catching a fly mid-air and pulling it into its mouth. The master exhales slowly, still serene. "But we do not chase the flies..." Beat. "...not during class." The guilty frog freezes, then lowers its head in visible shame, folding its hands back into the meditative pose. The other frogs resume their chant: "Ommm..." Camera holds for a moment on the embarrassed frog, eyes closed too tightly, pretending nothing happened.
9. A warm, intimate cinematic performance inside a cozy, wood-paneled bar, lit with soft amber practical lights and shallow depth of field that creates glowing bokeh in the background. The shot opens in a medium close-up on a young female singer in her 20s with short brown hair and bangs, singing into a microphone while strumming an acoustic guitar, her eyes closed and posture relaxed. The camera slowly arcs left around her, keeping her face and mic in sharp focus as two male band members playing guitars remain softly blurred behind her. Warm light wraps around her face and hair as framed photos and wooden walls drift past in the background. Ambient live music fills the space, led by her clear vocals over gentle acoustic strumming.

11. EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET - MORNING - LIVE NEWS BROADCAST The shot opens on a news reporter standing in front of a row of cordoned-off cars, yellow caution tape fluttering behind him. The light is warm, early sun reflecting off the camera lens. The faint hum of chatter and distant drilling fills the air. The reporter, composed but visibly excited, looks directly into the camera, microphone in hand. Reporter (live): "Thank you, Sylvia. And yes - this is a sentence I never thought I'd say on live television - but this morning, here in the quiet town of New Castle, Vermont... black gold has been found!" He gestures slightly toward the field behind him. Reporter (grinning): "If my cameraman can pan over, you'll see what all the excitement's about." The camera pans right, slowly revealing a construction site surrounded by workers in hard hats. A beat of silence - then, with a sudden roar, a geyser of oil erupts from the ground, blasting upward in a violent plume. Workers cheer and scramble, the black stream glistening in the morning light. The camera shakes slightly, trying to stay focused through the chaos. Reporter (off-screen, shouting over the noise): "There it is, folks - the moment New Castle will never forget!" The camera catches the sunlight gleaming off the oil mist before pulling back, revealing the entire scene - the small-town skyline silhouetted against the wild fountain of oil.
12. A focused ceramic artist with a shaved head, thin eyebrow slit, and small hoop earring stands in a sunlit pottery studio, framed by shelves of clay bowls and dust-covered tools. Soft window light filters through high panes and casts gentle bands across their face and a clay-smudged apron. The camera holds a steady medium close-up from slightly below eye level, giving the moment a quiet intensity as their eyes lock on the viewer. They speak in a calm, precise tone; their mouth moves naturally and their brow lifts on key words, with small micro-expressions flickering as a faint smirk appears. At the peak of a line about kiln time, they pause, then shift into surprise, eyes widening and eyebrows shooting up as their head pulls back and their posture loosens. They blink rapidly, gesture once in disbelief, and the composed focus gives way to genuine astonishment. Studio ambience hums underneath with a distant wheel whir, soft room tone, and a faint breeze moving a hanging tarp in the background. Dialogue: "You know the definition of insanity? It is glazing all day for a 10-minute firing." Brief pause. "Wait... this firing is 15 minutes? What the heck?"
13. EXT., DAY — claymation medium close-up with sunlight, hand-crafted textures, and visible stop-motion fingerprints; a clay bunny rabbit sits on a tree trunk facing the camera. The rabbit has large cute eyes, white fur and pink ears. His fur is clean and soft looking. A garden is behind the rabbit. The rabbit's glossy clay eyes blink as it leans forward, mouth shaping each word clearly, and it lifts one paw in a mild, exasperated gesture. “For the last time,” it says in a frustrated voice, “I do not eat carrots! Because of that stupid Bugs Bunny every time I go to a dinner party, it's carrots, carrots, carrots!” while its ears flop with each syllable. The camera slowly pushes in to emphasize the rabbit's face and the tiny creases in the clay as it looks directly into the camera and throws up its paws and says "Enough with the carrots!". Faint nature sounds and soft clay squeaks accompany the stop-motion movement, with the rabbit's voice crisp and centered.
