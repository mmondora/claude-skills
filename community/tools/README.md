### anthropics/skills — skill-creator

The official `skill-creator` skill from Anthropic can generate new skills
from documentation or existing code. It's included in the community skills
under `community/skills/anthropic-official/skill-creator/`.

**Usage**: Copy the skill into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory,
then ask Claude Code to create a new skill based on your documentation.
